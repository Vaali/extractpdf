Main aim of the project is to extract data from pdfs and trying to plot the relevant data from the data.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the relevant pdfs and put them in a directory named data.
3. Install the requirements by running following command
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Run generatecsv.py which extracts data from pdf files. This expects data to be in DATA_DIRECTORY from utils. 
```python generatecsv.py```
